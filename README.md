# VolumeRendering
The project named 'VolumeRendering' simulates an example of the large-scale meteorological data visualization. It is implemented in World Wind (.NET version) using Direct3D and HLSL. The development platform for the project is Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.

The experiment data is Typhoon Rananim, which is one of the strongest and devastating typhoons that occurred in the northwest Pacific Ocean in 2004. The dataset was originally provided by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and then generated in GrADS gridded data format using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The latitude ranges from 9.0262N to 45.1072N, the longitude ranges from 85.9631W to 143.9630W, and the altitude ranges from 100m to 1000m. As the volumetric data is very thin and close to Earth surface, the volume data in the vertical direction is exaggerated for better performance. 

This project realizes an efficient dynamic volume rendering for large-scale meteorological data in a virtual globe. Since the volume data covers a large area, the viewing line can be approximately calculated by the ray from the camera to Earth center. Compared with the octree-based multiresolution method, the key point of our method is to slice the spherical shaped volume along the viewing ray as a whole. As a result, the visualization effect is smoother and the rendering is more efficient.
